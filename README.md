# Regression_Model_Using_Keras
- This repository contains a regression model built using Keras.
- The code will be split into 4 parts:
  - Part A: Splitting the dataset into train and test sets 50 times, and training on 50 epochs each time while calculating the mean squared error for each time.
  - Part B: Same as Part A, but the dataset is normalized.
  - Part C: Same as Part B, but increasing the epochs to 100.
  - Part D: Same as Part B, but increasing the number of hidden layers.
- The dataset used in this repo is: https://cocl.us/concrete_data

- This code is the final assignment of [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras?specialization=ai-engineer) provided by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/eg-en) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
